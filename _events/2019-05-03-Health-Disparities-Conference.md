description: Louisiana is ranked near the bottom of all states in overall health. Substantial health disparities exist among minority and rural groups of people in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of disease. Health and well-being disparities exist across racial and ethnic origin, as well as gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. A systematic approach is needed to define major health disparities and well-being issues and generate and implement strategies to address these issues. LSU is committed to improving the health, well being, and longevity of Louisiana citizens through organized research, education and intervention strategies. The Health Disparities and Well being Conference has three main goals- Outline the health disparities problem, Highlight current LSU and community efforts towards addressing health disparities, Foster collaborations to help develop and implement new intervention strategies. The Conference is open to all those interested to attend. Registration is now open. Those registered will be receiving boxed lunch free of charge. May 3rd, 2019 Save the Date!

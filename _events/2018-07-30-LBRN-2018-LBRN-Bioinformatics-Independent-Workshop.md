description: In this workshop, we will be focusing on application of the methods we learned about in online modules Transcriptomics 1, 2, and 3 to your project ideas. We will discuss the datasets that you started preparing and how the analysis tools you learned to use could be effectively applied to these datasets. We will also review some more methods for data exploration, visualization and preparation for the poster.

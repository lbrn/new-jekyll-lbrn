    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) sponsors a summer research program in support of undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty from any Louisiana institute. We offer qualified participants the opportunity to work in established research laboratories at Louisiana State University, LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, Tulane Medical Center, or Tulane National Primate Research Center. The goal of our program and funding is to support biomedical research through an increase in graduate school admissions in these scientific fields and make Louisiana researchers more competitive in obtaining federal funding for research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schedule for undergraduate students covers nine weeks during the summer; the summer program dates are {{ page.eventDate }}. The schedule for graduate students and faculty is more flexible. It is expected that an agreement be reached between the program participant (undergraduate student, graduate student or funded faculty) and the intended mentor. It is expected that the agreement to mentor an LBRN participant is a mutual one between the intended mentor and the funded participant.
    </p>
    <p class="important">LSU Baton Rouge and Tulane University faculty, graduate students and undergraduate students are not eligible to apply.</p>

    <h2>Mentorship</h2>
    <h3>Participant Expectations</h3>
    <p>The LBRN program expects that our participants perform full time research for the period of funding. We do not allow for other jobs, teaching or classes or vacations to be scheduled during the funding period; fellowships (undergraduate students), stipends (graduate students), and summer salaries (faculty) are sufficient to enable the funded participant to focus 100% on the research project during the funding period. The student participant may become involved in a research project that is ongoing in the chosen laboratory, or design a project in collaboration with the intended mentor.</p>

      <h2>Faculty Mentor Expectations</h2>
      <p>As the mentor of a faculty participant in our program it is expected that you will enter in to a collaborative relationship on an agreed upon project. You may expect to receive scientific and professional collaboration from the funded researcher. Equipment ordered for the funded research, unless otherwise specified, will belong to the funded researcher and will be housed at their home institution upon completion of the program funding period. You may also expect to have input in the determination of the requested supplies and equipment, which are part of the application process for faculty in our program. Our faculty summer program culminates in a written progress report of the research project. It is expected that an LBRN funded faculty researcher will receive guidance from their research laboratory and mentor in preparing this work and that the finished product be a professional progress report.</p>

      <p>As the mentor of an undergraduate student in our program, it is expected that you will oversee the training of the student participant and monitor their progress while they are working on the agreed upon project in your laboratory. As a mentor you can expect serious and professional work from your LBRN funded researcher while they are working in your laboratory. In addition to a wages to the undergraduate participant, we offer a supply fee of up to $1,000 per student to the research laboratory to help defer the cost of supplies for the funded project. Our undergraduate summer program culminates in the Summer Undergraduate Research Forum (SURF) where our program participants, along with other undergraduate summer research students across the campus, are invited to present their research in the form of a poster. It is expected that an LBRN funded undergraduate will receive guidance from their research laboratory in preparing this presentation and that a portion of the supply fee will be set aside to produce the poster </p>

  	<h2>Scholarship Program</h2>
	<p>Existing LBRN Summer Program Undergraduate participants who have completed fewer than 60 total semester credit hours as of May 2019 are eligible to participate in the LBRN Undergraduate Scholars Program following completion of the Summer Research Program. Note: we may relax this criteria at our discretion, those with more than the allotted credit hours will be considered on a case by case basis. After participating the summer program, if you're eligible for the Scholarship program you will receive notification usually the during the month following the end of the summer program.</p>

	<p>This program will provide a more extensive research experience by allowing existing summer program participants to extend their summer program participation into the academic year at their mentoring laboratory or home PUI campus. Students would be paid for working up to 10 hours per week in a research lab during the fall and spring semesters for a total of 30 weeks at a rate of $8/hr, up to 10 hours per week, not to exceed $2,400. Up to $1,000 will be available to help support laboratory supplies for the research. In the case where the student attends a PUI campus close to their mentoring institution for the summer can continue to work on the research they began during the summer. Students who elect to work at their home campus, that is not near a mentoring institution, will require a research mentor on their campus and and outline a potential project.</p>

	<p>There are two options to this program:</p>

	<p><b>Option 1</b>: Academic-year extension on a Biomedical Research Intensive (BRI) campus.</p>

	<p>This option is open to students who demonstrate that they will continue to make regular progress toward their degree while pursuing the research opportunity. Because of the proximity of many of our PUI institutions to research campuses, there are opportunities for many students, i.e. Xavier students working at Tulane or LSUHSC-NO, LSU-S students working at LSUHSC-S, etc. to continue their summer research project on the BRI campus.  </p>

	<p><b>Option 2</b>: Academic year extension on home PUI campus. </p>

	<p>Students will need to identify an appropriate research mentor on their campus and outline a potential project for the following academic year. Ideally this project would involve studying a question related to and/or using technologies similar to their summer research experience. This option allows students from PUI campuses that are not geographically close to a research campus the option for extending their research experience.  </p>


	<h3>Scholarship Program Application</h3>

	<p>Participants who are eligible will automatically receive an application link near or after the end of their participation in the current summer research program. Eligibility will depend on the mentor who agrees to continue the program with the eligible student and meeting the requirements as outlined above.</p>

	<p>The application process will require the following documentation (scanned pdf to the online form):</p>

	<p><ul><ol>1. A letter of support from the mentor with the following:  </ol>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Statement of commitment to mentor the student for the academic year.  </li>
			<li>1 Paragraph description (briefly) of research.  </li>
			<li>Letter submitted on University Department Letterhead and signed.  </li>
		</ul>
		<ol>2. For option 2, the Mentor's CV in addition to the letter of support.  </ol>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Who is eligible?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students who are attending a university or college in the state of Louisiana, except LSU Baton Rouge and Tulane students.</li>
      <li>Students who are not graduating between January through August of the same year as the summer program year.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What are the program dates?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 2019 Program {{ page.eventDate }} for Undergraduate and Graduate student participants.</li>
      <li>Dates for Faculty participants may be flexible, need to be stated in your proposal application.</li>
      <li>Due to the limited availability of housing during the summer, adjustments cannot be made to the start and end dates of the program to accommodate students with other scheduling conflicts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Am I required to be on the LSU campus (or other research facility) for the full term?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes. Ten weeks may sound like a long time, but it is a very short period in which to do any meaningful research. Undergraduates must attend the opening meetings and participate in the poster session on the final day. You will also be required to attend weekly seminar meetings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What hours do I work?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the LSU LBRN Summer Research Program is probably an undergraduate’s first attempt at real scientific research, it is hard to explain the variability. You will be expected to work when the work needs to be done. Experiments don’t always run on the timescale we’d like them to. You must be willing to work some late nights and lots of weekends.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Can I live off campus?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, you may live anywhere you would like; however, our program can only pay for housing within the proscribed Campus Apartments or Dorms for students working at one of our approved mentoring institutions per the application.</li>
      <li>If you reside in the same city as the mentoring institution; for students who currently live at home or already have an apartment in the mentoring city, please stay there and we cannot reimburse rents.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>May I take classes or have another job during the summer program?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No. Ten weeks may sound like a long time, but it is a very short period in which to do any meaningful research. You will be working with your group and may not have free time; therefore, we do not allow student researchers to take classes or hold an outside job. You must be willing to devote your entire attention to the program.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From whom should I solicit Letters of Recommendation?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your recommendation letters are very important. They should all be from faculty members who know you quite well. If somebody can only say that you made an ““A”” in their class, you’ve wasted a letter because we can look at your transcripts and know that. Two of your letters need to be from science faculty members, and one of these may be from your proposed mentor. Recommendation letters have to be submitted through our application process. See the Summer Research Program Letters of Recommendation page for instructions and the link to provide to your faculty to LBRN@lsu.edu.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How do I choose a mentor professor and a project?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are ultimately responsible for choosing your mentor and project. You will need to contact faculty members directly to ask about working with them. If you have any questions, please contact the LBRN office by email lbrn@lsu.edu.</li>
      <li>There is a prospective mentor list for Undergraduate, Graduate and Faculty Researchers listed under: Summer Research Mentors, that page is also for those Faculty at research institutions who wish to mentor students. The list gets updated frequently through the end of year as we refresh the list, mentors have to sign back up each year so the list is current</li>
      <li>When the mentor confirms to mentor you for the summer, this does not guarantee you being selected for the program, only available slot in his/her lab.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What type of training will I receive?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An individual research project will be assigned to you by your mentor (Undergraduates).</li>
      <li>Training on and first-hand use of state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation will be provided.</li>
      <li>Group instruction will also be provided in general research issues and practices such as scientific ethics, chemical and radiation safety, laboratory notebook keeping, print and on-line scientific literature searches, presentation of research results, and scientific writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What are some of the activities planned for the program?</p>
    <ul>

<p>Following the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network Summer Bioinformatics Program 2 Day Workshop we had on June 25-26th, the third workshop is taking place on July 30th at LSU Digital Media Center at the Center for Computation and Technology auditorium. This is a continuation of the program that started June 6 and last through July-August, providing students and faculty access to online resources and <!--more-->practical experiences analyzing large biomedical datasets. In this workshop, we will be focusing on application of the methods we learned about in online modules Transcriptomics 1, 2, and 3 to your project ideas. We will discuss the datasets that you started preparing and how the analysis tools you learned to use could be effectively applied to these datasets. We will also review some more methods for data exploration, visualization and preparation for the poster.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the CCT/LBRN - Pine Biotech Fall/Winter Bioinformatics course for LSU/LBRN Network institutions Students, Grad and Undergrad, PostDocs and Faculty members. In preparation for this Course we are planning to hold an Orientation session On Monday October 22nd, 2018 from 10am - 12 pm at LSU CCT. <!--more-->The session will also be streamed via Vibe (formerly ViewMe) Video conferencing software. The session will give an outline of the courses that will be offered during the Fall/Summer session, and timeline for the various modules and interactive sessions. Faculty/Students/post docs will have 1 week to then decide to register for the course by October 29th, 2018. LSUCCT will support 50 site licenses in total. Students, post docs and faculty are encouraged to attend this orientation session on Monday October 22nd, and avail this excellent opportunity to get trained in Bioinformatics.</p>

<ul>
<ol>1. On-site attendance<br>
<p>Conference room# 1034 at Center for Computation & Technology, LSU, 340 E Parker Blvd, Baton Rouge, LA 70808</p>
</ol><br>

<ol>2. Video conference attendance<br>

<p>You can join your meeting entitled LBRNCCT-Bioinformatics by entering the Meeting ID into the Viewme application <b>"LBRNCCT-Bioinformatics"</b>.
Download Vibe client for free at <a href="https://vibe.ezuce.com/download/">https://vibe.ezuce.com/download/</a> no login account needed.</p>
 
<p>Or by using WebRTC in Chrome or Firefox: <a href="https://vibe.ezuce.com/webrtc/?meetingID=2147516440">https://vibe.ezuce.com/webrtc/?meetingID=2147516440</a> (recommend downloading client for best experience, however if difficulty connecting with client due to your network restrictions, use WebRTC link)</p>

<p>Test ahead of time in our test room: INBRE-TEST-2018. Please note only up to 5 connections can test at a time and the video will be lower quality than the actual session. The actual session will require you to 'raise hand' option to participate with audio and video during Q&A.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have difficulties connecting with the downloaded client or iOS or Android App, use the WebRTC option from the website as indicated above. If you still have issues, contact <a href="mailto:johnq@lsu.edu">John Quebedeaux - johnq@lsu.edu</a> and do so by this Thursday afternoon so he can get back to you by friday afternoon at the latest. The sooner the better - note that networking difficulties with institutions may take several days to resolve.</p>

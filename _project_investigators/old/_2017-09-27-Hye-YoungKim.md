<p>The main goal of the proposed research project is for the Principal Investigator to acquire the expertise that would enable her to become a federally funded independent researcher in the area of computational biophysics, emphasizing the fundamental and applied aspects of the development of novel self-assembled drug delivery vehicles. This goal will be achieved by leveraging and enhancing the following two sets of objectives: (1) professional development objectives that will enable the PI to quickly acquire the professional reputation and new expertise in the field of computational biomedicine to match her outstanding research ability and background, and (2) research objectives, which will enable the PI to contribute to an important area of research in biomedicine using large-scale atomistic and coarse-grained computer simulations.

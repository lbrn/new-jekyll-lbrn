===
Training and education
//COPY workshops block from events
//Link to workshops page

split page to left/right
//or top /bottom

//Training & Education will probably need pulldown for the three items listed at the top of the page:BioinformaticsLecturesWorkshops


backburner:
carosuel; consider an image for TNE
home page alternative layout consideration
maybe update footer? with map and a bunch of links, stuff that's buried otherwise
//consider linking projectreporter nih . gov page
//https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9902045&icde=51604231

//and also nih.gov and nigms.nih.gov

//safari has issues w/ about page cores icon, bbc/mcbr too big

//Cores > services page: BBC always above MCBR in the services section

//Double check Research page if any of the links have expired


//NIH-acknowledgement the code at the bottom needs to be updated to -19

highlights carousel image
style like emma's things the backgrounds under resources

//change "summer research program" carousel item to "current activities" link to virtual summer program

change the header image depending on which page you're on - need different ones for different things
 (Cores is a computing and biomedical, look at templates, tne/connectsions and learning, cores go back to the blue or combo or such )

White version; other version where text on logo is dark blue
border: kinda fancy
Need space for name AND signature, pretty seperated
move logo somewhere else for need, corner or top

typefaces and sizes
border
thin lines for name one name two, smaller name one name two , larger full name  those need to be small and full name (maybe uni) need to be larger

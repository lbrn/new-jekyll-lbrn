//Title links to core page

===
Training and education
//COPY workshops block from events
//Link to workshops page

split page to left/right
//or top /bottom
//add list with TNE tagged news articles
//only thing missing is moving a link to workshop over
tag anything i think is training
some are research, students means not training, but a bootcamp workshop training courses
courses counts as education

//Icon - start people as new faculty, pipeline of project stuff -
research pipeline, people into research, particularly biomedical
takes more then 5 yrs to do
growth of a person or people through research pipeline
look at funding period bullets like williams hart
translational - translate from research to testing

//new factuly, then pilot, then full, then translational - research pipeline

//segmented pipeline like symbols - D R P P spread on them

replace placeholders on workshop page with tagged "workshop" articles

tag workshop:
3rd lbrn loni scientific computing bootcamp
2019 illumina training as workshop
summer bioinformatics workshop june 30th one

Start with news archive format first
then try block format

-Annual meetings block on events page
-increase size of highlights title
highlights awards story is upcoming
change order - put news ahead of the events/highlights on mobile
highlights in chronological order
hide twitter on mobile

//disable hover over dropdown on mobile menu

two images from highlights on carousel

Training & Education will probably need pulldown for the three items listed at the top of the page:

Bioinformatics
Lectures
Workshops


backburner:

Ramesh feedback -
Research hub > research
People link on pulldown on about
-add a block on about that goes to people?
-Would be above Goals

Cores link - Move the research hub core content to its own page
Take services, core bucks, core resources to Cores page


copy descs from about page, with icon
BBC first
Then list out all of the services (core services)
insert link icon to about page

Research:

Add new DRPP section at the top
//Text Change - on PIs - change "one to two years" to "one year" and startup funded projects to two years
//for "Both" add both of the cores icons instead of the neutural

Email with info + email with photo
//Change "Current" activites to Activities

Where we have the workshop block :

//Education page: title update
//Training and education
Move workshop block to training and education, leave the core icon

Front Page
//Add highlights section
for links to awards that we've given to people success stories, maybe like events? link and date
Link to page with success stories and awards

Campus highlights, carousel piece: Take to highlights
Take picture from LSU/LAtech
Campus highlights collage
comment out old slide
create a commented out carousel slide for cores

//The Louisiana Biomedical Research Network consists of people made up from the Administrative Core, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core, Molecular and Cell Biology Resources Core, Currently Funded Project Investigators of all types, Past Funded Project Investigators, Primarily Undergraduate Institutional Steering Committee Members, and External Advisory Committee Members.

//Title links to core page
//maybe icon?

===
Training and education
//COPY workshops block from events
//Link to workshops page

split page to left/right
//or top /bottom
//add list with TNE tagged news articles
//only thing missing is moving a link to workshop over
tag anything i think is training
some are research, students means not training, but a bootcamp workshop training courses
courses counts as education

research pipeline, people into research, particularly biomedical


//new factuly, then pilot, then full, then translational - research pipeline

//segmented pipeline like symbols - D R P P spread on them

//replace placeholders on workshop page with tagged "workshop" articles

//tag workshop:
//3rd lbrn loni scientific computing bootcamp
//2019 illumina training as workshop
//summer bioinformatics workshop june 30th one

//Start with news archive format first
then try block format

-Annual meetings block on events page
//-increase size of highlights title
//highlights awards story is upcoming
//change order - put news ahead of the events/highlights on mobile
//highlights in chronological order
//hide twitter on mobile

//disable hover over dropdown on mobile menu

two images from highlights on carousel

//Training & Education will probably need pulldown for the three items listed at the top of the page:BioinformaticsLecturesWorkshops


backburner:
carosuel; consider an image for TNE
home page alternative layout consideration
maybe update footer? with map and a bunch of links, stuff that's buried otherwise
//consider linking projectreporter nih . gov page
//https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9902045&icde=51604231

//and also nih.gov and nigms.nih.gov
dont need www

gopher, mosaic, both world wide web

//////////////////////////
9-9-2020 meeting
//////////////////////////

//highlights still reversed

//safari has issues w/ about page cores icon, bbc/mcbr too big

//Cores > services page: BBC always above MCBR in the services section

//Double check Research page if any of the links have expired


//NIH-acknowledgement the code at the bottom needs to be updated to -19

highlights carousel image
style like emma's things the backgrounds under resources

//change "summer research program" carousel item to "current activities" link to virtual summer program

change the header image depending on which page you're on - need different ones for different things
 (Cores is a computing and biomedical, look at templates, tne/connectsions and learning, cores go back to the blue or combo or such )

 ///////////////
 9-14-2020 meeting
 //////////////




 -Consider bbc/mcbr circle style into head bg

 - About, to be updated later, notes for doctor horswell and doctor park likely to be removed

 //-add dates to highlights page version

 //- About, redirect the title links that bbc/mcbr to "cores" page

 //-NIH-links change Human Subjects Research (45 CFR 46) to Office for Human Research Protections

===============
9-22-2020
===============
move the TNE lower image off of link
Change the size of one of the two images, make white largest, bioinfo second, other last

Highlights: crop the curtains a bit

make text blue and leave the rest green

BBC one that uses the digital numbers like one of the templates on the resources page

other helix design is a possibility too

one green one blue?

Certificate of completion Large text
date near that
For the completion of the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network 2020 Summer Research Program Undergraduate Program

presented to:
dont need presented by text

White version; other version where text on logo is dark blue
border: kinda fancy
Need space for name AND signature, pretty seperated
move logo somewhere else for need, corner or top
border around logo like stamp, put in lower right

===
headers
like lower right green for bbc

mix and match dna into blue bbc logo thing
fill in circle on green with binary stuff and then do dna on blue
green for one, blue for the other - blue for comp/bbc and green for mcb
more subtle colors for blue left side one


===========

typefaces and sizes
border
thin lines for name one name two, smaller name one name two , larger full name  those need to be small and full name (maybe uni) need to be larger
quarter inch edges and inch and a half top
capitalize completeion

embed typeface

12-7-2020-meeting

test website is up
versions of the graphics

flip entire image

//bbc logo green could be a bit darker , saturate a bit more? maybe grab from header

//remove 2nd dna helix right next to the thing, remove the //circle one and the overlapping background one

//try: hide extra dna
//less thick lines, darker on left maybe?
//move visible binary
//in blue dna on the green side? green binary in circles ?
//move helix more towards the center

//try blue/green helix, matching the side its on

flip bg, make text pop more

maybe use on main page


//LBRN cores page : move text up, some overlap in area

merge main in, new stories


=========
12-15-2020
=========

//cores page : article like, text to the left of the logo

less parts to circle, less busy version

dark blue menu bar text and something

news button on menu bar

//potential widescreen stuff

outter edge highlight state?


priority:
//map first
//hide banner

in the logo for cores page: maginify glass, state, dna helix on page
we should
improve the logos on the LBRN logo
different versions playing with the colors we use for mcbr/bbc background while having the same or different image

hexagon logo pieced together which groups are represented based on logo
blue/green versions of the others

small version of dna helix

use the elements we have explored via banneretc
new hexagon versions
ties to zoom: affiliated with different cores
diff color versions

social media thing below highlights, also consider thicker font or change typeface

add news section
add news to the thing and move social media down

break up news via pages on jekyll

up the opacity a bit? etc

==============
1-12-2020
==============

new spreadsheet updates for PIs
on both main and dev website

double check last project type still matches, update end date
green ones are new, except Marjan who had a new project rather then translational; john needs to find out if hes the same title

ordered this list by project ID

green has added a new project and changed project type: no longer x, now whatever is in green

some still have the same mentors

yellow/delete = not active PIs

add new project type to pages, inbre suppliment

add: inbre suppliment category
in there: all the green ones
include the owrh mental health
orange means leave active

change collab to suppliment, display that as project type on page with filters, and then get more specific on page

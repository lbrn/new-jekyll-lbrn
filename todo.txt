===
Training and education
//COPY workshops block from events
//Link to workshops page

split page to left/right

//Training & Education will probably need pulldown for the three items listed at the top of the page:BioinformaticsLecturesWorkshops


backburner:
carosuel; consider an image for TNE
home page alternative layout consideration
maybe update footer? with map and a bunch of links, stuff that's buried otherwise
//consider linking projectreporter nih . gov page

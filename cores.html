          <h2>BBC </h2>
          <p>The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core (BBCC) of the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) serves to train and support project investigators and their teams across Louisiana, and to lead and support
            translational research activities at the frontiers of biomedical science. Its team uses both established and custom computational tools, operating at computational scales ranging from the mundane to analyses engaging many hundreds of
            compute cores.</p>

            <h2>MCBR </h2>

            <p>Molecular and cell biology provide an essential linkage among important basic fields of biomedical science, such as genetics, developmental biology, structural biology, immunology, neurobiology, and cancer biology. The MCBRC takes
              advantage of existing highly organized, centralized services and equipment facilities located primarily at the LSU flagship institution in Baton Rouge, effectively uniting these units toward the common goal of supporting biomedical
              research performed by PUI investigators. The MCBRC will provide technical and logistical support, enabling the ready exchange of information, ideas, technology, and research capabilities among PUI investigators. MCBRC will ensure that PUI
              researchers have full access to state-of-the-art equipment and modern research techniques and services. </p>

          <h2>NGS Equipment <img src="images/ri-cores-mcbr.svg" alt=""></h2>
          <p>GeneLab is equipped with a suite of Life Technologies NGS equipment including Ion Torrent PGM, Ion Proton, and Quant Studio Flex (digital PCR validation). In addition, GeneLab has a variety of equipment to support NGS, including qPCR machines (ABI 7500 and 7900 and QuantStudio Flex systems); Fragment Analyzer from Advanced analytics to validate and quantify nucleic acid samples for NGS sample preparation; an epMotion robotic arm for high-throughput set-up and sampling; various computers and other equipment enabling quality control of nucleic acid samples and preparing nucleic acid extractions from many samples at once. GeneLab provides NGS methodologies (genomics, transcriptomics) in a strategic alliance with the BBCC. GeneLab operates Ion PGM and Ion Proton NGS equipment, which are linked to a local cluster having more than 200 terabytes of storage through dedicated high-end workstations. A visualization server supports Windows as well as Linux environments, providing memory intensive visualization tasks and tools working on both operating system (OS) environments. A computational server equipped with substantial memory (128 GB) and large number of cores (32) is networked to the Ion PGM and Ion Proton platforms for analyses requiring a large memory footprint and multi-core performance applications. These two high-end servers are backed by a network-connected expandable NAS storage system, which are directly connected to the servers and software tools integrated to the sequencing platforms, resulting in total storage space of over 120 Terabytes at this time. BBCC staff work closely with GeneLab to transfer and analyze data.</p>

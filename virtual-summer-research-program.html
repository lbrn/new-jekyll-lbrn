      <p>LBRN is pleased to make available our <b>2020 Virtual Summer Program Opportunities</b> for LBRN participants. This program is in place of our regular summer program, which was cancelled due to COVID-19. This program will proceed in various virtual/online formats with support from our LBRN PUI campuses and Pine BioTech.

Deadline for registration is June 1, 2020. Program begins June 8, 2020. Applications will be reviewed on a first come basis immediately after the deadline.

Please see the following listed programs available for all the program details from each participating LBRN Partner.

     <ul>
     <li><b>Omics Logic Basics.</b> This program is best suited for students interested to learn about various -omics technologies and how bioinformatics is used in biotechnology, healthcare, agriculture and basic research.  Program access provides access to all the asynchronous* online courses (basic course certificates only). This can be taken at the same time as ALL the other programs. *This project can be taken at the same time with any other project listed for our virtual summer program.</li>
	<li><b>*Bioinformatics for Infectious Diseases.</b> This program uses genomics to understand the COVID-19 pandemic. Available to all undergraduate students / scientists.
	</li>
	<li><b>*SARS-COV2: Genomic Data Analysis.</b> This program is dedicated to the study of viral diversity and its role in epidemic infectious diseases that keep re-emerging, including zoonotic spillover, transmission between humans and the process of viral and bacterial disease development. Participants will get a chance to learn about bioinformatics and analyze genomic data by applying various analysis approaches to study viral genomes. 
	</ul>
	<p><i>*Contact session schedule will updated on the 29th of May.</p></i>

Students will learn about visualizations and visualization packages (such as Tableau, 3D.js, Circos, Google Charts, etc.) and how to apply them to various data.</div></li>

	<li><div><a href="downloads/2020 LSU-S (CADD) of Anti-Viral Therapeutics for COVID-19.pdf"><img src="images/postImages/2020 LSU-S (CADD) of Anti-Viral Therapeutics for COVID-19.png" alt="2020 LSU-S (CADD) of Anti-Viral Therapeutics for COVID-19 Program Information" style="float:right;width:200px;border:0;padding-left:20px;"></a><b>Computational-Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) of Anti-Viral Therapeutics for COVID-19.</b> The students will recognize the availability and the ease of retrieval of a substantial amount of annotated chemical and structural biology data and how these are leveraged in inquiry-based research projects.  Web-accessible databases and cheminformatics tools facilitate linking of multi-layered and cross-referenced data into an effective framework for early-stage drug design, discovery, and optimization. The students will also gain a practical knowledge of how the structure of drug molecules and biological protein receptors are represented to model and understand their similarities, physiochemical properties, and their interactions that lead to biological/therapeutic responses. Subsequently, they will use the data to create hypotheses that can be tested and validated both virtually and experimentally. </div></li>

     <li><div> <a href="downloads/2020 ULM Bacteriophage Annotation Project.pdf"><img src="images/postImages/2020 ULM Bacteriophage Annotation Project.png" alt="2020 LSU-S Information Visualization Program Information" style="float:right;width:200px;border:0;padding-left:20px;"></a><b>Bacteriophage Investigations – in Silico Bacteriophage Annotation Project.</b> The aim of this program is to discover and characterize a new Actinobacter phage (viruses that infect bacteria of the various Actinobacter species). The data generated will be incorporated with the data of other participating institutions. The discoveries made in this lab will increase our knowledge of bacteriophage diversity, genetics, and evolution. It is data that will be published and disseminated to other scientists world-wide. Therefore, you will not just be a student; you will also be a scientist.

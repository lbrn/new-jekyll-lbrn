<h2>Lectures on Informatics</h2><p>The BBC Core provides access to introductory lecture series on Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology topics.
<h3>The initial lecture series covered:</h3>
                <p><a href="http://metagenomics.lsuhsc.edu/lectures/introinformatics/">An Introduction to Computers and Informatics in the Health Sciences<a/> and
                <br>
                <p><a href="http://metagenomics.lsuhsc.edu/lectures/intromicrobiota/">An Introduction to Microbial Community Sequencing and Analysis.</a></p>
     <p>More recently we have added the lecture series on Molecular Structure and Function of Proteins.
     <br>
     <p>The introductory video is:<br>
     <p>Introduction to Protein Course and the first lecture you can <a href="https://youtu.be/Ql38HzIR2sg">watch here</a> without opt-in.<br>
     Basics of Amino Acids You must opt-in to this lecture series by <a href="https://redcap.lbrn.lsu.edu/surveys/?s=NPWD8HD4XJ">registering.</a></p>

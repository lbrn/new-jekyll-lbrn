Key goals of Dr. Thomas’ research program are to increase the understanding of the mechanisms of molecular change and develop critical links between molecular and organismal evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current research in his lab focuses on the application of next generation sequencing technologies to increase the understanding of response of organisms to environmental change and patterns of global biodiversity. Developing bioinformatics modules for workshops and curricula is a major output from his program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving his B.S. from University of Redlands (CA), Dr. Thomas was awarded his M.S. and Ph.D. in Biology from Simon Fraser University (B.C., Canada).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas has published over 170 peer reviewed publications, as well as numerous book chapters. He has received numerous national and international awards of distinction. In 2011, he received the UNH Excellence in Research Award. In 2014, Dr. Thomas was elected Fellow of the Society of Nematologists. Recently, he was named STEM Research Exemplar, Washington University (NIH sponsored program).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas has had sustained funding from prestigious national and international funding sources, including National Science Foundation: BAC Libraries from Diverse Crustacean Taxa Phylum Nematoda; Integrating Multidisciplinary Expertise Infrastructure for Resolving Relationships in a Major Branch of the Tree of Life; Accelerating the Molecular/ Morphological Inventory of Meiofauna; Marine Nematodes of Mexico’s Threatened Gulf of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Institutes of Health: The Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations; Daphnia Functional Comparative Genomics Resource; Bioinformatics “Train the Trainer” T3; The Integration of Bioinformatics into the Undergraduate Curriculum Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative: Genomic Responses to the Deepwater Horizon event and development of high-throughput biological assays for oil spills&lt;/p&gt;

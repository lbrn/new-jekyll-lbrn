The program will start June 6 and last through July-August, providing students and faculty access to online resources and p&lt;!--more--&gt;ractical experiences analyzing large biomedical datasets. Online materials will be reviewed in interactive sessions and on-site workshops that provide an opportunity to discuss and practice studied topics and analysis methods. The program will review major types of Next Generation Sequencing data types and analysis methods (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics), applications to research and clinical questions as well as machine learning concepts (supervised vs. unsupervised methods, dimension reduction, classification, feature selection, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We are excited to announce registration for the upcoming Louisiana Biomedical Research Network Summer Bioinformatics Program.

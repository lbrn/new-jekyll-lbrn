<h2>Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core Services</h2>
<p>The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core (BBCC) serves to train and support project investigators and their teams across Louisiana. It works to enable Louisiana Biomedical Research Network project PIs and their teams to employ Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (especially high performance computing), and to provide bioinformatics services, training, and educational support.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about services provided by the core or talk to someone in the core about how someone can assist you please use Cores Contact link:</p>

<h3>Training</h3>
<p>The core provides one on one training. If you have a question or would like to talk about your training needs, use the <a href="https://redcap.lbrn.lsu.edu/surveys/?s=JKJCL3QJ7E">Cores Contact Link.</a></p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>The core conducts workshops during the year, for the latest conference and workshops see: <a href="conference-on-biology-and-bioinformatics.html">LBRN Conference on Bioinformatics</a> and the <a href="training-workshops.html">LBRN Workshops</a>. Surveys are conducted prior to these workshops and during the year to best determine what topics to present and speakers to host.</p>
<h3>Core Bucks</h3>
<p>The BBC Core provides opportunities for researchers to acquire “Core Bucks” in order to support the informatics analysis of genomic data.  Core Bucks requests from member institutions should be initiated through the BBC Core representative for your campus.  Please see the <a href="downloads/BBCCoreBucksFlyer.pdf">Core Bucks Flyer</a> (link to PDF of attached flyer) for more details.</p>
<h3>Educational Lecture Series</h3>
<p>The BBC Core provides access to introductory lecture series on Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology topics which have been lecture captured.  These series can be utilized for informal learning or as a basis for a topical course offered for credit at your home institution.

<p>Two sets of lecture series are now available:
<ul>
	<il>• Past lecture series have covered “An Introduction to Computers and Informatics in the Health Sciences” and “An Introduction to Microbial Community Sequencing and Analysis”. These Lecture descriptions, archived stream links, and lecture materials are all available for access at the <a href="http://metagenomics.lsuhsc.edu/lectures/">Lecture Series Site</a>.</il>
	<br>
	<il>• Latest lecture series on Molecular Structure and Function of Proteins. You must opt-in to this lecture series by registering at this link:
		<!-- title="Protein Course Opt-In"  -->
		<a	href="https://redcap.lbrn.lsu.edu/surveys/?s=NPWD8HD4XJ">Protein Course Opt-In</a>. An introductory video is <a href="https://youtu.be/Ql38HzIR2sg">Introduction to Protein Course</a> and the first lecture you can watch here without opt-in: <a href="https://youtu.be/ABXAGqhdUY4">Part 1: Basics of Amino Acids</a></il>
</ul></p>

<p>Additional lecture series are in the process of creation and will be added to the Lecture Series Site as they are delivered.</p>

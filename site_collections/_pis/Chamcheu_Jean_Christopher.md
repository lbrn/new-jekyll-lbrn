<p>The major goal of this proposal is to establish the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in psoriasis pathogenesis and to evaluate the potential of fisetin, a dietary polyphenol for its management. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects more than 125 million people worldwide (1,2), with ≈8 million in the US alone(1-3). The pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood but involves the dynamic interplay between immune cells and the skin (4). Hyperproliferation and aberrant keratinocytes differentiation and, inflammation with disrupted skin barrier are prominent features (1,2). While not fatal, psoriasis significantly decline patients’ quality of life, with increased risk of arthritis and cardiovascular diseases(4,5). Treatments for mild/moderate psoriasis have proved frustrating and remain elusive, thus understanding the pathogenesis and identifying new targets are critical to develop novel and effective long-term management of psoriasis. Emerging data suggest that of the many signaling implicated in psoriasis, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which regulates cell growth/angiogenesis, is upregulated both in human psoriatic and imiquimod-induced mouse psoriasis-like lesions(3-6). Hence, this pathway is critical in psoriasis and a clinically relevant therapeutic target. Also, our studies identified the small molecule fisetin, that binds mTOR/S6K1 as a potent second-generation mTOR kinase inhibitor (17). Further data indicate that fisetin in monotherapy or combined with activating agents, induce differentiation markers and AP-1 factor subunits in keratinocytes, and inhibit i) proliferation, ii) PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, and iii) secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by both keratinocytes and activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that “PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is a valid molecular target in psoriasis pathogenesis and, fisetin will inhibit the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and therefore induce differentiation, accelerate cornification, inhibit inflammation, and reduce the severity of psoriasiform lesions by inhibiting proliferation, angiogenesis”</p>

This is a continuation of the program that started June 6 and last through July-August, providing students and faculty access to online resources and practical experiences analyzing large biomedical datasets. The workshop will focus on "Processing and Understanding RNA-seq Data‚Äù and "Machine Learning for Transcriptomic Data". Online materials will be reviewed in interactive sessions and this is one of the on-site workshops that provide an opportunity to discuss and practice studied topics and analysis methods.

Due to Hurricane Zeta, the new event date/time is November 6, 2020, 1:00pm from October 30th, 2020 1:00pm.

We welcome you to join us for a free webinar on bioinformatics for Infectious Diseases. In this
session, we will discuss how genomic data and bioinformatics are being used to study viral
and bacterial pathogens and play a major role in the current biomedical research around the
COVID-19 pandemic. The webinar is designed for students and faculty interested in methods
of analysis, including RNA and DNA sequencing data.<!--more-->

<h3>Topics we will cover:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>	Analysis methods and tools for genomic and transcriptomic data analysis of hostpathogen interaction</li>
	<li>	Methods to study relationships based on local and global multiple sequence alignment (MSA)</li>
	<li>	Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies used for genome ancestry and population fitness  </li>
	<li>	Chemical and structural implications of sequence variation mapped on PDB models  </li>
	<li>	Host-pathogen interaction and treatment response  </li>
</ul>

Pine Biotech will also showcase some of the latest developments on the T-BioInfo platform designed
for virology studies and introduce the upcoming Omics Logic training programs for those
interested in effective utilization of bioinformatics for infectious diseases, immunology and
microbiology.

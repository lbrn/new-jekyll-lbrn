As of June 22, 2020 - The Governor of Louisiana is holding the state in Phase 2 regarding the Coronavirus. We remind all our partners, faculty, and students of maintaining safety and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. As you know, the current situation in Louisiana is still currently fluid with regards to the Coronavirus (COVID-19). <!--more-->

LBRN is based at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge with administrative staff at LSU School of Veterinary Medicine and the LSU Center for Computation & Technology. We shifted to working remotely on March 17th and we continue to handle the day to day activities of the grant. Any announcements regarding our activities will come out as needed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to drop us a note at [LBRN E-mail](mailto:lbrn@.lsu.edu) if you are not already in touch with us directly.

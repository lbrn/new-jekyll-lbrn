Dr. Gus Kousoulas, Principal Investigator of the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) that fosters biomedical research throughout Louisiana and supported by the NIH:NIGMS INBRE program, invites you to this follow up lecture given by Elia, Brodsky, CEO of Pine Biotech, Inc in collaboration with the Tauber Bioinformatics Research Center, University of Haifa, Israel and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN). <!--more-->

The topics that are covered in  this lecture are:

1. Overview of Covid-19 genomic data, genome structure, genes/proteins and data properties (assembled vs reads, mutation types, amino acid changes).  

2. Finding and Downloading a dataset of genomes from current and past corona virus outbreaks, different hosts and locations and learn to compare them in a meaningful way.  

3. Interpreting analysis results - visualizing and making sense of genomic analysis by correlating change in sequence with functionality.  

4. Comparison of the 3-dimensional structure and features of Spike (S) Glycoprotein encoded by SARS-CoV-2,  SARS-CoV-1 and Bat coronaviruses.

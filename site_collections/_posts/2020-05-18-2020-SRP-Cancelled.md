Thank you for your interest in the LBRN Summer Research Program. We regret that owing to COVID-19 related issues LBRN Summer Research Program as advertised for 2020 is cancelled. <!--more-->

<p>Plans are underway to have a virtual Summer program with at least four different modules/modes available for participants. We will have more details including registration information posted on the LBRN website soon. We hope to start this virtual summer program on June 8th. </p>

<p>We realize these are unique times that we live in posing a variety of different challenges to all. Rest assured that we at the LBRN are trying our best to provide an enriching summer research/educational experience. </p>

<p>More details coming soon. In the meanwhile sit tight and stay safe.</p>

<p>With best regards, Team LBRN</p>
